This year, guests can experience the "suite life" at Four Seasons Hotel Prague. The Suite Getaway package includes luxurious accommodation in newly renovated suites, American breakfast either at CottoCrudo restaurant or in the room, one-way limousine transfers from the airport to the Hotel and 25 percent savings on any of the Hotel's Spa treatments druing the stay. The offer can be booked with rates starting at EUR 885 per night.

Four Seasons Hotel Prague offers 20 suites among 161 rooms, and they vary in design from more contemporary to classic with a historical ambiance.  “I would recommend staying in one of our River Suites offering one-of-a-kind views of the Prague Castle, Lesser Town and Vltava River. You feel you have Prague on the palm of your hand,” says Petr Zezula, Chef Concierge.

“I am very much enjoying spring and looking forward to summer season. Life has moved outdoors here in Prague. Parks are blooming, restaurants and cafes are opening their terraces. It's an amazing time to be in Prague! Also, after last year's success, we have just re- launched the Four Seasons boat taking our guests on a hour ride on the Vltava River while enjoying a glass of prosecco and views of the city majors sights, including the Charles Bridge, National Theatre, Prague Castle, Lesser Town and more  – definitely an experience not to be missed when staying with us," adds Petr.﻿

Mount St. Helens at 35: 3D Visualization | View 1 | NASA
May 16, 2015: On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens gave way to a cataclysmic flank collapse, avalanche, and explosion that killed 57 people and displaced many others. The event dramatically reshaped the volcano and surrounding land in southwest Washington, USA. Now, 35 years later, satellites in orbit and scientists on the ground still monitor the mountain and track its recovery. This image shows a three-dimensional view the mountain, looking toward the southeast, as it appeared on April 30, 2015. The image was assembled from data acquired by the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on Terra.

The mountain’s north flank was the site of the collapse and lateral explosion that devastated 390 square kilometers (150 square miles) of the landscape. 

Scientists also keep a vigilant watch on the inside of the crater, where two lava domes have formed. In this image, the dome in the crater’s foreground grew until 1986, at which time the volcano became quiet again. Renewed activity in 2004—followed by a phase of lava extrusion that lasted until 2008—formed a second lava dome immediately behind the first.

On the left side of the top image, log rafts are still visible in Spirit Lake. These drifting rafts are composed of floating trees, thousands of which were uprooted and carried there in 1980. The raft is gradually shrinking in size from year to year as trees sink to the bottom of the lake.

Not visible in this image, however, is the 2,600-meter-long (8,500-foot-long) drainage tunnel constructed in 1985 to carry water from the lake, through a ridge, and into a nearby creek. Eruption debris had blocked the natural outlet into North Fork Toutle River, so the tunnel was built to control the water level and prevent a potentially disastrous flood. News reports say the tunnel is becoming constricted and “needs work.”

Motorola phones: old vs new, small vs big, sturdy vs fragile

My first Motorola phone was a  V195 and it's sturdy basic phone that I still find handy to slip in my pocket for emergencies. My new Nexus 6 is a lovely sleek mobile phone (and computer), but is far too big for my pockets, and I'd never be able to toss it about like my old V195.

Contemporary Apartment by Smart Design Studio

The Heritage is a building where the architecture and interiors have been designed together, seamlessly as one. It’s also a building where two different scales and styles, separated by 100 years of construction, are brought together. The nett result is a building that forms a refined transition between North Sydney CBD and the surrounding suburban areas, enjoying the benefits of both.

The end of voodoo? GOP changes Reagan approach to tax cuts...

"“It” is the tenet that cutting income taxes will generate enough growth that lower tax rates actually increase the amount of taxes flowing into the government.

Like Reagan, Republicans pursuing the White House in 2016 want to cut taxes. Unlike Reagan, though, they’re not promising a flood of new tax revenues.

“We’ve seen a number of episodes where it didn’t work,” said Kevin Logan, chief economist for HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., an arm of the giant global bank HSBC, pointing to the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts under President George W. Bush that helped turn a budget surplus into a steep deficit.

At the state level, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas slashed tax rates in 2012 and is now struggling with budget shortfalls exceeding $600 million."

The end of voodoo? GOP changes Reagan approach to tax cuts

tri-cityherald.com

George H.W. Bush famously called it voodoo economics. Ronald Reagan called it a winner, took the White House in a landslide and it’s been a mainstay of Republican fiscal policy ever since.

What is duplicate content?

Duplicate content mostly refers to content at different sites or URLs that is inherently similar. Search spiders don't like duplicate content because they don't want to show visitors the same results. If your site has duplicate content, search robots can penalize it and not give it priority ranking on search results. 

Duplicate content 

Many websites have duplicate content problems. When search bots find duplicate content they choose one of the pages to list in the index, and can ignore the other.

IT Innovators: Free Web Portal Tool Helps IT Administrators Transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 Healthcare Codes

An assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago has come up with a free tool to help you with the mandated transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 healthcare codes this October. It takes on convolution and reduces costly errors. Want to know more?

Andrew Boyd, assistant professor of biomedical and health information sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago







.


Shouldn’t you be able to quickly tell when healthcare codes don’t match up? That’s the question Andrew Boyd, an assistant professor of biomedical and health information sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, asked when he found out about the U.S. healthcare system’s upcoming transition to a new coding system.

On October 1, 2015, the $3 trillion U.S. healthcare system will begin transitioning from the ICD-9 to the ICD-10 coding system. While ICD-9 provided about 14,000 codes for doctors and hospitals to choose from when billing insurance companies for various patient treatments, ICD-10 includes more than 80,000 codes. Further complicating matters, the code definitions are not apples-to-apples. For example, when using the ICD-9 coding system, a patient can be described as having either a “depressive episode” or “clinical depression.” In the new coding system, both types of depression are classified as “depressive disorder.”

These changes mean big challenges ahead for IT administrators. Come October 1, when they run reports on things like the best treatment for a specific condition or to evaluate the safety of a particular hospital, they’ll have to compare two sets of data with different collections of codes and definitions.

Boyd quickly realized what was at risk with this coding transition. He was concerned that the switch would invite costly errors in coding and patient information, as well as inaccurate reports or reports that were easily skewed. For example, a hospital looking to paint a misleading picture when it comes to safety could potentially leave out important sets of data from previous years, just because the new coding system doesn’t have similar definitions.

Boyd knew there had to be a solution to this dilemma; a way to simplify the transition to the ICD-10 coding system. So, he set out to create an algorithm to identify when definitions are convoluted and when certain reports are near impossible.

What Boyd and a team of researchers came up with is a free web portal tool and translation tables designed to provide IT administrators guidance on ambiguous and complex translations, and to reveal where analyses may be challenging or impossible. The tool identifies bi-directional conversions and their level of complexity, which includes identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no mapping.

“Every single healthcare encounter is assigned one of these codes,” Boyd says. “Anyone who wants to understand what’s going on runs reports. Even small practices have incentive payments based on these codes.”

Boyd adds that, “The coding system is used to make many decisions in healthcare, from specific conditions that are affected seasonally to identifying problem areas in hospitals, such as when more nurses are needed or where supplies are falling short. There was too much at risk to not address the differences in these two coding systems.”

With Boyd’s algorithm, an IT administrator can quickly determine problem areas, predict potential errors and improve productivity when running reports. If an IT administrator is looking to run a list of 10 codes related to depression, for example, all they have to do is plug data into Boyd’s algorithm and they can quickly find out which code definitions are convoluted. The IT administrator can then sit down with a domain expert or a professional encoder to see if the report would still be possible, or if they need to decide to map to other codes.

The concept behind Boyd’s algorithm is applicable to many different scenarios. For example, it can also apply to data collected from dating websites, when looking at male and female groups and nonreciprocal relationships between the two groups.  

Boyd is hopeful that his algorithm will help solve a complex problem. “In 3 or 4 years, billions of dollars in Medicare payments will be tied to these new definitions,” he says. “We hope this tool will help IT administrators determine which areas within the two sets of data are worth investing the time or money in to hopefully find a solution.”

Boyd adds, “In other cases, it might be okay to go with, say, a 10 percent error when running certain reports, especially if it’s intended to be used internally. It helps knowing that’s the case, so practices can take that into consideration.”
